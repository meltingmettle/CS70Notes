the old tests

Random notes: 
Draw the problem out to get an idea of what they're claiming.  

Strategies:
WOP - Choose a largest/smallest/first day.  "Say there is a longest cycle c..."
Contradiction (on induction?)
Strengthen by adding something similar with n.  
Create a variable.  "Say there is a vertex v..."


Propositions
FLT for 2^50


1.  + mod(k,2)
  If your answer depends on whether k is odd or even, throw this onto your answer. :D  Evaluates to one if k is odd and 0 if k is even.
  (I.E Maximum number of colors required to color a planar circle graph with k vertices? 2 + mod(k,2).  2 if even, 3 if odd.
  
2.  A graph denoted by K sub n is a complete graph.  The largest planar K is K4.  K5 cannot be planar.

3. Euler's Formulas
  e <= 3v - 6
  e <= 2v - 4 for a bipartite graph
  v + f = e + 2
  
4. Euler's GCD.  Yeah.

5. Propositions:
  For All distributes among "and".
  There Exists distributes among "or"
  ¬(P∨Q)⟺(¬P)∧(¬Q)
  ¬(P∧Q)⟺(¬P)∨(¬Q)
  ¬(∀xP(x))⟺∃x¬P(x)
  ¬(∃xP(x))⟺∀x¬P(x)

6. Find good timing! :D
