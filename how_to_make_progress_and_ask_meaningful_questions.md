As I was driving to work and reflecting on my work experience thus far, I realized that I was still utilizing a problem-solving approach which I picked up during CS70, which actually revolutionized my CS70 career.

I'm writing this advice from the perspective of both the student and the teacher, but also the employee and coworker. 
Hopefully, this will enable you to learn FROM being stuck and ask meaningful questions which don't make you feel bad for asking. (Will help at work)


I'm working on a full stack web/database project in C#, Javascript, and SQL, none of which I've really worked with before. By learning to ask questions the right way, I've managed to independently solve and create different approaches to problems.

# How to Learn From Being Stuck and Not Feel Bad About Asking Questions

Every time someone starts solving problems in new area or concept of study, there will almost certainly come a time when he or she gets stuck. 

Sometimes, the student will have absolutely no idea what the proof or solution should even look like.  
There will seem to be an insurmountable challenge and a vaguely distant, possibly possible solution with clear way forward. (The first thing to try would be to look at solutions to similar problems and mimic them, but this is not always possible or thorough)

Well, good news! That's ok, and actually one of the best learning opportunities you can experience, if responded to properly!
(If you already knew how to solve the problems, why would you be in the class?)

**The first thing to avoid, and the option that most humans tend towards, is the response of "I don't know what to do", or "What should I do here?".**
Unfortunately, this stuck-feeling won't go away when you get a job or when you finish this class, and this type of question will, frankly, make you feel stupid for asking repeatedly.


From a teacher's persective, this is also difficult to address, because we don't know exactly where you're stuck, or how to guide you in the right direction without planting the idea in your head.

# TL;DR solution: Ask a Proposal

Make an educated guess on a solution or a path forward, and ask "Should I try to show that ______?" or "Would ______ be a wise approach?".  Ideally, your question should be 1-3 sentences, explaining a couple possible options and the reason why each one doesn't quite work.


Your guess will very rarely be on point at first, but that's ok!
As you formulate your answer, you'll get to mull over different approaches and issues, and possibly stumble upon the soultion!
A well-thought-out questiopn will highlight what you don't understand or why your approach won't work,
and eventually it will boil down to a specific issue or explanation on a specific concept.
This will be enough for your teacher or boss to guide you in the right direction using YOUR problem solving abilities!

So the next time you're stuck on a hypercube proof or a complex recursive problem, (*~cough towers of hanoi*), present your best guess as your question, and use that to get started in the right direction.

**If you're already using this approach, good job!** Keep developing that intution! With practice, your guesses should help you get closer and closer to the solution, if you don't solve the problem along the way.  This same practice of thinking it out and guessing towards a solution will help you on exams and future projects where you may have less guidance available. (Debugging is a whole new game, but similar) 
 
Fun fact: This tends to be distinguishing feature between those who enjoy studying CS and those who opt for a different path of study.  Frankly, the questions "Is this right?" or "What should I do here?" are lazy; the question itself is not meaningful and conveys a sense of defeat, regardless of the effort put in. XD

Good luck!  
Love you guys! I pray for you all every day! :D 

I'll see you guys soon!
