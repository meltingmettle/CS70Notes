    Don't worry about money,
    Do something cool, and care about people
    and it's going to turn something around.
    
I know it's easier said than done, but don't worry about your grade.  Don't worry about your major.  That time will come in itself.  
Try to enjoy and learn the material.  Prepare for midterms like an obstacle course.  Train as hard as you can, then run the race and give it your best.
    
    Those rides to and from school were basically parades, celebrating 'cause we knew we'd make it
    
Let's do it!
