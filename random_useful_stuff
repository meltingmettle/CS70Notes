Don't fall behind lol.  Wednesday, do Data HW, but also read a note for 70 and do two hws. 

Tomorrow's schedule:
DT
Practice
Guerilla Section
Review all three midterms
Cheat sheet
Euler's
Read Coloring, Bijection, WOP
Stable roommatesL one where it works, one where it doesn't. 


Random notes: 
Draw the problem out to get an idea of what they're claiming.  

Strategies:
WOP - Choose a largest/smallest/first day.  "Say there is a longest cycle c..."
Contradiction (on induction?)
Strengthen by adding something similar with n.  
Create a variable.  "Say there is a vertex v..."


Propositions
FLT for 2^50


1.  + mod(k,2)
  If your answer depends on whether k is odd or even, throw this onto your answer. :D  Evaluates to one if k is odd and 0 if k is even.
  (I.E Maximum number of colors required to color a planar circle graph with k vertices? 2 + mod(k,2).  2 if even, 3 if odd.
  
2.  A graph denoted by K sub n is a complete graph.  The largest planar K is K4.  K5 cannot be planar.

3. Euler's Formulas
  e <= 3v - 6
  e <= 2v - 4 for a bipartite graph
  v + f = e + 2
  
4. Euler's GCD.  Yeah.

5. Propositions:
  For All distributes among "and".
  There Exists distributes among "or"
  ¬(P∨Q)⟺(¬P)∧(¬Q)
  ¬(P∧Q)⟺(¬P)∨(¬Q)
  ¬(∀xP(x))⟺∃x¬P(x)
  ¬(∃xP(x))⟺∀x¬P(x)

6. Find good timing! :D

7. Stable Roommates 

8. Walks and crap

9. Graphs to consider for counterexamples and such
  base cases: lone stuff
  complete graphs
  trees
  hypercubes
  
10. Associated mod tricks:
  Day of the year
  365 * n + leap years
  1 * n + leap years
  Days from today
  
  some number ^ (some number)
  FLT- 2 ^ 50 (mod 65) -> 13 * 5 = 65
  2 ^ (12 * 4) = 1 
  1 * 2^2 
  4
  OR
  4 = -1 mod 5
  4 ^ 96 mod 5 = 1
  
11. Hypercube Definitions

12. Tree definitions

13.  Paths and crap

14.  IMPORTANT: Prepositions cannot have a free variable. 

15. Not P or Q   ===>  P implies Q
