Counting by bijection:

If you recognize that the Law of the Excluded Middle applies to a problem, counting by bijection may be viable.
Basically, for a problem like "The subset of all numbers which sum greater than 638 in the sum of {1, 2, ....50}" or "How many ways are there for P to be on the left of G in a random arrangement of the letters of "GRACEPOINT".

Either it sums to 638 or it doesn't.  Either P is on the left of G or it isn't. 
As such, of all possible combinations/arrangements of letters, P will be to the left of G in half of the arrangements, so (all total possible arrangements)/2 would be the answer.  (Too lazy to calculate; sorry XD)

Formally, "There is a bijection between the arrangements where P is to the left of G and P is to the right of G. As such, there will be ....)

You dig?

Send me example problems with counting by bijection because I can't find any good examples that won't spoil your homeworks or practice midterms. :'D


As kind of a hack, for those types of "number sum to" problems, the number has to be in the exact middle of the set of sums, and it usually is given to you that way.  If not, you'd be screwed.
