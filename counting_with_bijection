Counting by bijection:

If you recognize that the Law of the Excluded Middle applies to a problem, counting by bijection may be viable.
Basically, for a problem like "The subset of all numbers which sum to 638" or "How many ways are there for P to be on the left of G in a random arrangement of the letters of "GRACEPOINT".

Either it sums to 638 or it doesn't.  Either P is on the left of G or it isn't. 
As such, of all possible combinations/arrangements of letters, P will be to the left of G in half of the arrangements, so (all total possible arrangements)/2 would be the answer.  (Too lazy to calculate; sorry XD)

You dig?

Send me example problems with counting by bijection because I can't find any good examples that won't spoil your homeworks or practice midterms. :'D
